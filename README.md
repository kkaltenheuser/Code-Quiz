# Code-Quiz

ReadMe: This project was an opportunity to engage and test higher level Javascript, alongside what I have already been learning in class. It was built from the first line of code all the way to the last, typing and scanning and debugging and continually repeating as I navigated what was not connecting or when there were excess(or missing) curly brackets. Debugging is necessary because it not only creates tension for the file and its performance but it because it is essential to the experience of the user.
Stamina is vital in these moments because it would be easy to give up on any visual remenants of the quiz or interactivity and just have it as plain code, but that too would require a different type of debugging which would necessitate the implementation of a user interface so that there isn't the discomfort and tension of unfinished work.
As a young developer, I exist in a constant, fluctuating state of learning and exploration and application and in turn, growth. 
This project works to address the user and their knowledge of semantics and general Javascript, it provides immediate feedback to the user and the gamification of their results while storing their successes locally. It addresses an element of inclusivity that often in the UI/design world that we ignore which is the necessity of accessibility even if we scoff at drop shadows and bevels, it makes it easier to read for those who experience difficulty in sight. 
I learned and was continually reminded of the value of stamina especially when it came to this project because there were so many moments where you are watching yet another video on Javascript and reviewing your in-class notes wondering why your code isn't working. Yet, you persist and you figure it out and learn more about what allows you to get into your workflow and the invaluable tool that is "google-fu". Javascript is an difficult and technical language that allows everything around us to function, while it is newer in its broad use, it will not be ending anytime soon especially as culture continues to shift in the wake of the pandemic and technological experiences become even more vital. 
When coding in JS, you have to pseudo code, it is akin to the outline a writer drafts when sharing their words with the world. 
What makes my project stand out is the willingness to continue pushing code, asking how to make it start to have a semblance of UI even at base level CSS. If someone new to javascript were to stumble upon it, they would learn more about what Javascript is like; if they are accustomed to Javascript, it is a fun moment to refresh memory and recall their own time learning Javascript. Every single developer brings their own special approach to writing out code and setting up quizzes and inserting Boostrap (if they so choose).
